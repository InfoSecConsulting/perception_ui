Perception is a tool used to gain better network visibility and aid in Vulnerability Management

===============================================================================================

PostgreSQL 8.4 and ^ is supported.

PostgreSQL 8.4 has been tested.

=================================

This tool is still under development and has not been fully released. There are two parts to this
tool.

1) Perception User Interface

    The User Interface will provide the front end GUI for setup and reporting.

2) Perception Logic

    The Logic is the backend AKA (The business end). The business end provides the scanning
    and parsing of the XML reports generated by nmap, openvas, metasploit and other tools
    found in Kali Linux. These logic scripts and daemons will populate the database to enable
    Systems and Security Admins with the information they will need to setup amd maintain
    better firewall and IPS rules. This tools will be fully integrated with the VSENSOR project
    and with a support contract InfoSec Systems will deploy these tools as OVA's for VMware.
